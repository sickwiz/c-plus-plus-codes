/*
PROBLEM -
The span si of a stockâ€™s price on a certain day i is the minimum number of consecutive days (up to the current day) 
the price of the stock has been less than its price on that ith day. If for a particular day, if no stock price is
 greater then just count the number of days till 0th day including current day.
For eg. if given price array is {3, 6, 8, 1, 2}, span for 4th day (which has price 2) is 2 because minimum count 
of consecutive days (including 4th day itself) from current day which has price less than 4th day is 2 
(i.e. day 3 & 4). Similarly, span for 2nd day is 3 because no stock price in left is greater than 2nd day's price.
 So count is 3 till 0th day.
Given an input array with all stock prices, you need to return the array with corresponding spans of each day.
